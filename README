# clojure-euler

This is my attempt to solve the euler problems using clojure. 
If anyone comes across this code and thinks that it sucks, well, it probably because i am just learning clojure!

Problems solved

1-2

## Usage

To run solutions, run lein repl
Where N is the problem number

user=> (require '[problems.problemN :as problemN] :reload)
nil
user=> (problemN/solution 1)                              
Total:  0
nil
user=> (problemN/solution 5)
Total:  3
nil
